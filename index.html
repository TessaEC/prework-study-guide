        <ul>
          <li>The <mark><b>head</b></mark> element contains information about the webpage AKA Metadata.</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Metadata</b>> is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The opening tag and closing tag are represented with angle brackets (< header > =open < / header > =close) </li>
          <ul>
            <li>In between these angle brackets will include the content and other nested elements</li>
        </ul>
          <li>Example of some elements included in header:</li>
          <ul>
            <li> < ! DOCTYPE html > tells web browser what doc type to expect on the page</li>
            <li> < html lang = " en " > tells browser language is en for English</li>
            <li> < title > defines title for webpage</li>
            <li> < style > defines CSS style associates with website</li>
            <li> < base > defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
            <li> < link > connects an external resource to the HTML doc.</li>

            <li> < script > embeds client-side scripts in the HTML doc.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li>The <b><mark>body</mark></b> element represents the visible content shown to the user AKA <u>parent</u> element</li>
          <li>Nested elements within the body are called <u>child</u> elements</li>
          <ul>
            <li>child elements are mostly <b>semantic</b> where the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on the web page.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Examples of some semantic elements nested within the parent element:
          <ul>
            <li> < h1 > through < h6 > represents level of heading to appear on page</li>
            <li> < p > paragraph</li>

            <li> < li > listed items</li>
            <li> < ol > ordered list(numbered/new indented line)</li>
            <li> < b > bolds the word or words in between open and close</li>

            <li> < img > contains info about an image that will show on the web page-can contain various attributes: </li>
          <ul>
              <li> src = defines location of image to show on page</li>
              <li> alt = provides description and functionality of the image (used for screen readers and other assistive technologies <br>
                -can also improve engine rankings)</li>
              <li> width = width of image</li>
              <li> height = height of image</li>
              <li> / > ends image information</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> < br / > shows line break on page </li>
            <li> < br > breaks at inserted point of line - can wrap text to next line.</li>
            <li> < section > defines a section in a doc. that contains thematic content</li>
            <li> < a > anchor creates links to the same webpage or other pages and can contain other attributes:

              <ul>
                <ul>
                <li> href = points to the URL for the link, Example: < a hrf = " insert hyperlink " > insert text for hyperlink < / a ></li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
          <li>Examples of <b>non-semantic</b> elements: 
          <ul>
            <li> < div > to create a division in the page</li>
            <li> < span > to create an inline division</li>

        <ul>
          <li><b><mark>Inline</mark> CSS</b> - applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
            <ul>
              <li>quick and permanent changes</li>
              <li>less flexible than internal/external style sheets due to each line style must be edited individually.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><b><mark>Internal CSS</mark></b> - contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the html file</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Rules only apply to that page</li>
              <li>Can configure CSS class and IDs-used to identify elements-to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><b><mark>External</mark> CSS</b> - Link from separate CSS file is placed in HTML head - Allows developers to keep all of their CSS rules in separate files</li>
            <ul>
              <li>easier</li>
              <li>most common</li>
            </ul>
          <li><b>Separation of concerns</b> - term in web dev. refers to separating code into diff. files based on use, the idea that ea. sections <br>
            of code should have it's own responsibility.</li>
          <li><b>Selector</b> defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declaration will apply.</li>
          <li><b>Property</b>dictates which aspect of the selector will be changed visually.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Width declaration - makes element __ % of the available width (ex. width : 80% ;)</li>
              <li>Margin declaration - assigns __px to the top and bottom of element (ex. margin : 40px auto ;)</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Auto value = to the left and right</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Border property - to border with width of __px + color of border (Ex. border : 5px solid gray ;)</li>
              <li>Box Shadow - adds shadow effects around an elements frame. (Ex. box - shadow : 5px 10px blue ;)</li>
            </ul>
          <li><b>Value</b> is what the chosen CSS property will be changed to.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>You can select colors by name OR by its hexadecimal code AKA hex #</li>
            </ul>
          <li><b>Declaration</b> contains 2 components = CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li> 
          <li><b>Margin</b> property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li><b>Padding</b> property indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li><b>CSS box rule</b> - think of every HTML element as a box. Ea box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's <br>
            borders, padding and content.</li>
          <li><b>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code</b> - a coding principal that reduces the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li><b>Class attributes</b> allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to an attribute with a selector, then the att. can be <br>
            assigned to the element in html, enabling choice of which elements will get the CSS rule.</li>
          <li><b>Selectors:</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Asterisk symbol is a special wild card symbol - declares that ALL of the elements on the page will have the same style properties</li>
              <li>Comma allows us to combine 2 or more selectors into a single CSS rule which allows the declarations to affect all selectors stated.</li>
              <li>. card, the period designates this as a class selector. HTML elements assigned to card will get the property assignments from CSS</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Example: applied declarations to CSS file-linked in html to each<br />
                    < section > as < section < class = " card " id = " git - section " ></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          <li><b><u>To link an External CSS file to HTML: </b></u></li>
            <ul>
              <li>we store metadata in the < head ></li>
              <li>insert link to CSS file after < head > before < title > (Ex. < link rel = "stylesheet" href = " ./ assets / style . css" >)</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>link - creates connection</li>
                  <li>rel - specifies relationship b/w the current doc. and the linked doc. resource</li>
                  <li>href - specifies the location (URL) of the external resource-using a relative path which means the location is derived from the current location <br>
                    (index . html). To locate the style sheet from current location = assets / style . css(our file name).
